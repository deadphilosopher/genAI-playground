 This file contains code for generating a maze, finding a path between two points in the maze using an iterative approach, and visualizing the maze and the path using Java Swing.

The `grid` function generates a grid of coordinates based on the input width and height. The `maze` function generates a random maze by connecting the coordinates in the grid with each other. The `ariadne-zip` function creates a zipper data structure for navigating through the maze, and the `draw` function visualizes the maze and the path using Java Swing.

The main part of the code generates a random maze, finds a path between two random points in the maze using the `ariadne-zip` function, and then visualizes the maze and the path using the `draw` function.

Areas for improvement:
- The documentation could be improved by adding more detailed explanations of each function's purpose, parameters, return values, and examples.
- There are some errors in the code that need to be fixed. For example, there is a typo in the `full-path` function definition, where `z/path` should be replaced with `full-path`. Also, in the filter function for finding the path, `first` should be replaced with `second` when checking if the current node is equal to the target node.
- The code could benefit from more comments to clarify complex or non-obvious parts of the implementation.
