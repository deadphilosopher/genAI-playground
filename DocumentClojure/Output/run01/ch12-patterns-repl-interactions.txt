 Title: Clojure Functions Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the various functions defined in this Clojure source code file. The primary goal is to ensure that users can understand and utilize these functions effectively in their projects. Below, each function is documented in detail, including its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples. Additionally, suggestions for improving clarity and comments are provided where necessary.

1. `my-app`: A Ring handler that returns an HTTP response with the requested URI embedded within an HTML body. This function takes a single parameter - a request map - and returns a response map containing status code, headers, and the formatted HTML body.

2. `wrap-logger`: A higher-order function (a function that takes another function as one of its arguments) that wraps around an existing handler function to log the requested URI before passing control to the underlying handler. This can be used for debugging or monitoring purposes.

3. `time-it`: A function that calculates and prints the execution time of a given function (passed as the first argument) with any additional arguments provided thereafter. It measures the elapsed time in milliseconds between when the function is called and when it completes, printing the result to standard output.

4. `foo`: A function that simulates an expensive computation by sleeping for a random duration (between 0 and 1000 milliseconds) and then returning the sum of its two arguments. This function serves as an example for demonstrating how to add timing information using aspect-oriented programming techniques with robert.hooke.

5. `intersection`: An example of utilizing the Clojure set library's intersection function, which finds the common elements between two sets (representing a range of numbers in this case). To demonstrate how to measure execution time for any function using robert.hooke, this call is wrapped with the `time-it` function using robert.hooke/add-hook.
