 Title: Clojure Function Documentation Guidelines

1. File Purpose Summary:
   - Briefly summarize the main goal or intended usage of the file. This could include any significant libraries used, the type of functions defined, and their general role in a larger system (if applicable).

2. Detailed Function Descriptions:
   - Each function should have its own section, with a clear name that describes its purpose or functionality.
   - For each function, specify its parameters and their expected types or values. If the function is variadic, make sure to document this.
   - Describe in detail what the function does, how it works, and any important assumptions made during its implementation.
   - Provide examples of usage, including edge cases if relevant. Use code comments for these examples when possible.
   - Document any side-effects or exceptions that could be thrown by the function, along with their conditions and expected behavior.
   - Mention any limitations or potential sources of error in using the function.

3. Comment and Clarity Improvements:
   - Use comments sparingly but effectively to highlight important decisions made during implementation, complex algorithms, or areas that could be confusing for others reading the code.
   - Ensure all variables have descriptive names. Avoid single-character variable names except for commonly used ones like 'i' in loops or 'k' and 'v' in map destructuring.
   - Follow a consistent indentation style throughout the file.
   - Separate logical sections of code with empty lines or comments to improve readability.
   - Break down long functions into smaller, more manageable ones if necessary.
   - Document any specific dependencies on external libraries used by the function.
