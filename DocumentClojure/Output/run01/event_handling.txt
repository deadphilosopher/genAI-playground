 ### Event Handling in Clojure: Salesorg Namespace

#### Overview:
This namespace `salesorg.event-handling` is designed to handle different types of events that occur within a sales organization. The file uses the `eventing.processing` library for processing these events. There are two main event types in this context, `'sales/purchase` and `'sales/lead-generation`.

#### Functions:
1. `process-event 'sales/purchase [evt]`
   - This function handles the 'sales/purchase' events. When invoked with an event (`evt`) containing a `:products` and a `:username`, it prints out a confirmation message showing what products were sold to which user. The event data is expected to be a map where `:products` are the items purchased by the user, and `:username` is the name of the user.
   - Parameters: `evt` (a map with keys `:products` and `:username`)
   - Return Value: None (it only prints out the confirmation message)
   - Example usage: `(process-event 'sales/purchase {:products "Laptop" :username "JohnDoe"})`

2. `process-event 'sales/lead-generation [evt]`
   - This function handles the 'sales/lead-generation' events. When invoked with an event (`evt`) containing information about a prospect, it prints out a message to add this prospect to the CRM system. The exact format of `evt` isn't specified in the code snippet provided.
   - Parameters: `evt` (any data type representing the lead generation event)
   - Return Value: None (it only prints out the confirmation message)
   - Example usage: `(process-event 'sales/lead-generation {:name "JaneDoe" :email "jane@example.com"})`

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. The function `process-event 'sales/purchase [evt]` assumes that `:products` and `:username` will always be present in the event map (`evt`). It would be more robust if it handled cases where these keys might not exist, returning an appropriate error message instead of causing a runtime exception.
2. Similarly, the function `process-event 'sales/lead-generation [evt]` doesn't specify what data structure or format is expected for `evt`. It would be beneficial to clarify this in comments or docstrings.
3. There are no comments explaining the purpose of the namespace as a whole, or any comments about how it interacts with other parts of the application. Adding these comments could improve maintainability and understanding.
