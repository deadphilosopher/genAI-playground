 This file contains two primary functions: `attrs` and `html`. The main purpose is to generate HTML tags with their corresponding attributes from a given data structure in Clojure.

1. **`attrs` Function**:
   - Parameters: Takes an attribute map as input. It expects the map to be either nil or a valid map of key-value pairs.
   - Return Value: The function generates a string representation of HTML attributes by concatenating each key with its corresponding value in the format `"key=\"value\""`.
   - Preconditions and Postconditions: The function uses precondition assertion to ensure that the input is either nil or a map. It does not have any postconditions defined explicitly, so there are no guarantees about what gets returned.

2. **`html` Function**:
   - Parameters: Accepts a data structure as input, which could be a vector, list, string, or a map containing `:tag`, `:attrs`, and `:content`.
   - Return Value: The function generates an HTML tag as a string based on the given data structure. If the input is not sequential (i.e., a string or a number), it returns the input as is. Otherwise, it treats the first element as a tag name and concatenates attributes and content to form the final HTML tag.
   - Preconditions and Postconditions: The function uses precondition assertion to ensure that the input is either a sequential data structure with a keyword, symbol, or string as its first element, or it is not a map. It also has a postcondition to ensure that the output is a string.

Areas for Improvement:
- Add examples and use cases in the documentation for better clarity.
- Handle edge cases more robustly in both functions (e.g., empty input, invalid data types).
- Use proper indentation and formatting for improved readability.
