 Documentation for processing.clj

  This is a Clojure source code file named "processing.clj" located in the "eventing" namespace. The primary purpose of this file is to handle event processing within an application, specifically categorizing and defining different types of events such as 'realtime' and 'archive'.

  1. Event Categories:
     - Realtime Events:
       * `sales/lead-generation` : This type of event refers to the generation of new leads in the sales domain. It is derived from the category `processing/realtime`, indicating that it requires instant processing and response.

       * `sales/purchase` : This event occurs when a purchase is made. Similar to lead-generation, it falls under the realtime category, meaning it demands immediate processing.
     - Archive Events:
       * `security/all` : All security-related events are categorized as archive events. This means they don't require immediate response but need to be stored for future analysis or auditing purposes.

       * `finance/all` : Similar to security events, all finance-related events fall under the archive category. These are events that occur in the financial domain and are meant to be stored and reviewed at a later time rather than requiring immediate processing.

  2. Event Processing:
     - `process-event` function: This is a multimethod function which takes an event as input, with :evt-type being the dispatching function. This allows for different behavior based on the type of event. However, no method bodies are provided in this code snippet, so it's not clear how events would be processed differently based on their type.
     - It is crucial to note that without additional method implementations for `process-event`, calling this function with an event will result in a runtime error as there is no default implementation and the dispatch function fails to match any defined methods.

  3. Areas of improvement:
     - Documentation and Comments: The file lacks detailed comments explaining what each section does, making it difficult for new developers to understand the code. Adding comments can significantly improve readability and maintainability.
     - Method implementations: Since this is a multimethod function, its behavior relies on method implementations that are not provided in this snippet. Providing these method bodies with clear documentation would allow other developers to understand how events of different types are processed.
