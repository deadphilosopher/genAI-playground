 File Name: ch10-REPL-oriented-repl-interactions.clj

Purpose: The file demonstrates various interactive development techniques using a Clojure REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). It includes creating a GUI to display and search for function names in the clojure.core namespace, working with exceptions, searching for functions, viewing source code, and managing namespaces. The file also illustrates partial function application, and an example of using an agent to implement a simple logging system.

Function Descriptions:
- `fn-names`: This is a list of public function names in the clojure.core namespace. It's used to populate a GUI component for browsing these functions.
- `show-info`: Displays documentation information about the currently selected function name from the fn-names list.
- `window`: A JFrame that contains a scrollable list of function names and a button that, when clicked, triggers the show-info function to display doc information about the selected function.
- `log-event` & `events`: These functions are used in conjunction with an agent to implement a simple logging system. The log-event function appends events to a list up to a maximum capacity of 5000, after which it starts overwriting older events. The events function returns the current state of the logged events.

Code Improvements:
1. Add comments for sections where complex logic or processes are occurring. For example, adding a comment above each defn or let block could be helpful.
2. Include type hints and metadata in function definitions to improve performance and readability.
3. Add error handling and validation checks where appropriate to ensure the robustness of the code.
4. Consider using more idiomatic Clojure constructs, such as `letfn` for defining functions within a scope.
5. Use meaningful variable names that accurately describe their purpose. This can improve the readability of the code and make it easier to understand.
