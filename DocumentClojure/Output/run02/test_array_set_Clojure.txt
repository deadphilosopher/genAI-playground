 Documentation for test_array_set.clj

Purpose:
This Clojure file is a testing suite for the 'array-set' function located in the 'com.clojurebook.array-set' namespace. The tests are designed to verify various aspects of the array-set functionality, such as correctness, immutability, promotion, and performance compared to hash-set.

Functions:
1. com.clojurebook.test-array-set/test-array-set: A test function that includes multiple subtests. It verifies the basic functionalities of array-set by comparing it with empty sets, single element sets, and character sets derived from strings. It also checks for membership and non-membership, as well as hash consistency.

2. com.clojurebook.test-array-set/verify-immutability: This test function ensures that the array-set remains unchanged after attempts to modify it by adding and then removing elements.

3. com.clojurebook.test-array-set/verify-promotion: This test confirms that when array-set is used with a larger number of elements, it automatically promotes from a persistent vector to a persistent hash set to maintain performance.

4. com.clojurebook.test-array-set/bench-set: A benchmarking function that times how long it takes for the specified number of trials to execute containment checks and random insertions and deletions on a collection created using either array-set or hash-set.

5. com.clojurebook.test-array-set/microbenchmark: A benchmarking helper function that runs the bench-set function for multiple sizes (1 to 4) with both array-set and hash-set, printing the results.

Suggested improvements:
1. More comments explaining the overall structure of the file and each test case in detail would be beneficial.
2. Add type hints or spec declarations for better code clarity and performance.
3. Use a different approach for verifying immutability (e.g., using transducers) to improve readability and efficiency.
4. Add a test case for checking the behavior of array-set with duplicate elements.
5. Consider adding tests for edge cases, such as empty collections or collections containing nil values.
