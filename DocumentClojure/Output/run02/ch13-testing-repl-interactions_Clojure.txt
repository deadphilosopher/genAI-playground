 This script contains functions for generating HTML code. Here is a high-level summary and detailed explanation:

**Summary:**
The main purpose of this script is to provide two primary functionalities: generating attribute strings for HTML tags based on input maps, and creating HTML elements with optional attributes and content from given data structures.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. `attrs` function:
   - **Purpose**: To generate an attribute string that can be inserted into an HTML tag. This function accepts a map of attribute-value pairs and returns a string where each pair is separated by a space, with the attribute name followed by "=" and then its quoted value.
   - **Parameters**: `attr-map` (a map where keys are strings representing attribute names and values can be any type).
   - **Precondition**: The input should be either a map or nil. This is enforced using a precondition check that throws an error if the condition is not met.
   - **Return Value**: A string containing the HTML attributes formatted as described above.

2. `html` function:
   - **Purpose**: To generate a string of HTML code for a given data structure, which could be a vector (where the first element is assumed to be the tag name and the rest are considered content), or a map with keys `:tag`, `:attrs`, and `:content`.
   - **Parameters**: `x` (a vector or a map representing an HTML element).
   - **Precondition**: If x is sequential, its first element should be either a keyword, symbol, or string. If it's not sequential, it shouldn't be a map. This is enforced using preconditions checks that throw errors if the conditions are not met.
   - **Postcondition**: The returned value should always be a string. This is enforced using a postcondition check that throws an error if the condition is not met.
   - **Return Value**: A string of HTML code for the given data structure.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- More comprehensive documentation and comments could be added to explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples of each function in more detail.
- The `html` function's handling of input data structures other than vectors and maps is not clearly specified or documented. It would be beneficial to provide clear guidance on how to use this function with different types of inputs.
